Spatial Models: Case of Prague
================
Petr Hrobař

# Source codes

In this study we apply ***Spatial Econometrics models*** and evaluate
flats prices. We suppose that **price** of the flat is not only the
function of flat’s own characteristics but also function of its
neighbourhood characteristics.

  - Firstly we test for spatial dependency
  - Then applying spatial models
  - lastly we evaluate model stability for various types of spatial
    matrix

Using Spatial Model we are able to evaluate prices with much better
percision.
