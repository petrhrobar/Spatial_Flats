In this study we apply ***Spatial Econometrics models*** and evaluate flats prices. We suppose that **price** of the flat is not only the function of flat's own characteristics but also function of its neighbourhood characteristics.

* Firstly we test for spatial dependency
* Then applying spatial models

```{r set knitr options, echo = FALSE}
# Defaultní nastavení
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = T,
                      message = FALSE,
                      warning = FALSE,
                      fig.width=12, fig.height=10)
```

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

Then plotting it:

```{r}
mtcars %>% 
  ggplot(aes(hp, qsec)) + 
  geom_point()
```
