# Source codes

In this study we apply ***Spatial Econometrics models*** and evaluate
flats prices. We suppose that **price** of the flat is not only the
function of flat’s own characteristics but also function of its
neighbourhood characteristics.

- Firstly we test for spatial dependency
- Then applying spatial models
- lastly we evaluate model stability for various types of spatial matrix

Using Spatial Model we are able to evaluate prices with much better percision.
